## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get your project up and running locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
-   **npm** (comes with Node.js)

To check if you already have them installed, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If not, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from the official website.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of your project folder.

## Features

### Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

-   HTML5 — Markup language for structuring content
-   CSS3 — Styling and responsive design
-   JavaScript — Interactivity and modular functionality
-   Swiper.js — Modern slider/carousel library

### Responsive Design

-   The entire project is **responsive** and optimized for **various screen sizes**

## Plans for Improvement

In the future, I plan to:

-   **Refactor** the code to improve structure and readability
-   **Optimize image handling**, since image-heavy projects tend to consume a lot of space/resources.

    ### Possible solutions:

    -   **Image compression**: Reduce file sizes to speed up loading
    -   **Move images to a server**: Offload assets from the client to improve performance and scalability

-   **Restructure the project’s file system** for better organization and maintainability:

These changes will make the project more efficient, easier to maintain, and ready for future scaling.
